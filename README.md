# Proof of concept
Webpack with UglifyJs3 / Harmony for ES6 optimization
- webpack 2.5.1
- uglify-es 3.0.10

## Warning
- no source maps
- does not keep comments (?)
- no caching or other optimizations
- error handling is untested and minimal
- passes the configuration object through to the uglify instance
